## Write for the Web

The way people read and make sense of content on the web is different from other mediums such as books, magazines and television. 

In this course you will learn how people use the web. We'll apply that understanding to write effective blog posts, calls to action and other content.

## Beyond Writing

The web supports a wide variety of rich media. We'll also cover when and how best to use photography, audio and video to reach your audiences. We'll also cover helpful processes and resources for your workflow and best practices to make your work discoverable by others.
